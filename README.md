# IDP-M110-2022

The ultimate objective is to find blocks and determine if they are magnetic and deliver to the correct area based on
whether they are magnetic or not. The area contains white lines for guidance. An obstacle is situated between the
starting the drop off areas and the collection area which can be avoided by using either a ramp or tunnel. Each time
a block is transported back across the obstacle a new block will be randomly placed in the collection area


Standard Specification:
• The robot must not have any sharp edges and must be safe around humans.
• The robot must display a flashing amber light (2Hz±10%) whenever it is moving.
• The robot must be of modular construction and use standard components where possible to allow easy
maintenance and repair in the field e.g. access to exchange motors, modules have plugs/sockets, fixings
accessible
• The robot must be well constructed i.e. not held together with tape and glue, unsupported/protected cables,
parts not fixed down
• The robot must be started in a controlled manner by pressing a push button switch or entering a command
on the workstation.
• The robot must clearly display the team number on top (visible to the overhead camera) for all testing in
black Arial font on a white background no smaller than 50mm high for all testing.
• All cabling must be neatly installed
• Cable colouring must conform to the site regulations: red power +, black power -, all other colours can be
used for signal/control
• A complete set of mechanical drawings and electrical drawings are required of a standard which would allow
another engineer to replicate the robot, or carry out repairs
• A software print out and flow chart is required
• Software should be maintainable and commented
• The robot must fit entirely in the start/finish area

The only interaction permitted is between the robot and a workstation. No information may be entered at the
terminal during a run, except for a single instruction for the robot to return. The same program must be run
after each restart.


Task Specific Specification:
• Blocks should be clearly identified before they are transported. This should be indicated by illuminating a red
LED for magnetic blocks and a green LED for non magnetic blocks. The LED should clearly illuminate for >5
seconds while the robot is stationary within 5cm of, but not touching the block
• The robot must not make contact with the block before it has been clearly identified by a red or green LED
• Magnetic blocks should be delivered to the Red drop off square, non-magnetic blocks should be delivered to
the green drop off square.
• The robot may traverse between the two sides of the table by either the ramp or tunnel
• Blocks will be scored for delivery at the end of the t
