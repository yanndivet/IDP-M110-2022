The ultimate objective is to find blocks and determine if they are magnetic and deliver to the correct area based on
whether they are magnetic or not. The area contains white lines for guidance. An obstacle is situated between the
starting the drop off areas and the collection area which can be avoided by using either a ramp or tunnel. Each time
a block is transported back across the obstacle a new block will be randomly placed in the collection area
